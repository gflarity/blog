It\u0026rsquo;s only been a few minutes but so far I\u0026rsquo;m very impressed with Atom. You should go check it out if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I like so far.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t call them plugins, they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026lsquo;packages\u0026rsquo; Shrug. Whatever you call them, their plugin/package system is great. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to install packages and the ones I\u0026rsquo;ve installed start working immediately without restart. Smells like there\u0026rsquo;s some good design under the hood.\nCommand Interface Autocomplete Packages can provide various \u0026lsquo;commands\u0026rsquo; you can run. Running these commands is like spot line on OS X. You type command + shift + P, then as you start typing it searches the commands. Very nice.\nGit integration with git-plus In particular the git integration seems interesting. When you edit a file, it indicates which lines have changed, and which are new. With the git-plus package installed it\u0026rsquo;s easy to run git commands without ever leaving your editor. Normally I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of IDE intgration with git. With the command searching interface, it\u0026rsquo;s fun.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s built with Electron It\u0026rsquo;s built with Electron which is also terrific as well. I think that\u0026rsquo;s separate post. But you should check it out if you want to build desktop apps using node.js + HTML5.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s FLOSS! It\u0026rsquo;s FLOSS. Turns out it\u0026rsquo;s made by GitHub. Lots of great FLOSS coming out of GitHub.

As a DBA-B-D (aka DevOps, aka Co-Founder), I find postgres lacking concise up-to-date documentation for getting specific tasks done quickly, or howtos. Replication is one such task. I had to merge bits and pieces from a number of sources, including mailing list posts, together in order to get what I wanted. I\u0026rsquo;m not complaining though, rather this my contribution to improving this situation.\nWhy Secure Replication The Cloud, aka outsourced VPS hosting with an API. Most of the documentation seems to expect you to be running this in our private secure network partitioned data center.\nHigh Level Overview TODO\nGet Yourself A Cert You\u0026rsquo;ll probably want to generate one yourself. THere\u0026rsquo;s not much point paying for a new one since you can easily distribute your own CA cert. Google it, there\u0026rsquo;s lot of info out there.\nOn The Master Update the postgres.conf on your master to enable WAL support for replication:   wal_level = hot_standby max_wal_senders = 3  Add the following to authorize the client to replicate against the db. Note that we\u0026rsquo;re only authorizing an SSL connection from replication user on all databases from $SLAVE_IP with password based authentication (md5).\n  hostssl replication all $SLAVE_IP/32 md5  Note: You\u0026rsquo;ll need to restart your postgres server for the wal related setting to take affect now.\nThe Postgres data dir for Ubuntu 12-04 is in /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll need an SSL key and cert and root cert (CA). You can generate your own CA and self signed cert if you want as well. To do so see the Keys and Certs section of this article.\nOn The Slave If postgres is running on the SLAVE, bring it down. You\u0026rsquo;re going to wipe out whatever is there and create a backup from the master.\nSwitch to postgres user from here on.\nFirst, delete the the contents of $PG_DATA ( /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main/ on Ubuntu/Debian ).\n  sudo su - postgres rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main/  Now use pg_basebackup to create the backup we\u0026rsquo;re going to start replicaiton from. You\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted for the postgres user password ($PG_PASS).\n  pg_basebackup -D /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main/ -x -h $MASTER_IP  As root, create links to the certs, including your CA/root cert.\n  sudo su cd /var/lib/postgresql/9.1/main/ ln -s /etc/ssl/certs/yourcert.crt server.crt ln -s /etc/ssl/private/yourkey.key server.key ln -s /etc/ssl/certs/root.crt root.cert  Once complete, create a file called recovery.conf with the following contents inside your postgres data dir on the slave.   standby_mode = \u0026lsquo;on\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026lsquo;touch\u0026rsquo; the file below to initiate fail over ( break replication, become read-write ) trigger_file = \u0026lsquo;$PG_DATA/failover\u0026rsquo; primary_conninfo=\u0026lsquo;host=$MASTER_IP port=5432 sslmode=verify-ca password=$PG_PASS\u0026rsquo;  Add the followng to the postgres.conf file:   hot_standby = on  Link to the root cert used to verify the master:   ln -s /etc/ssl/  Start postgres and tail the log, you should see replication starting. On Ubuntu:   service postgres start tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.1-main.log  ","href":"/posts/2013-02-14-secure-postgres-replication/","title":"Secure Replication With Postgres 9.1"},{"content":" I was having some issues getting my SSH Agent to forward. Turns out my understanding was completely inadequate. Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick run through for anyone else who might benefit.\nHigh Level Concept Say you have hosts A B C and you want to connect like so: A-\u0026gt;B-\u0026gt;C. SSH allows you forward your \u0026lsquo;Agent\u0026rsquo; such that your credentials for host A can be used on on host C as if B wasn\u0026rsquo;t even involved. It does so by forwarding a unix domain socket provided by A\u0026rsquo;s agent to B (usually in /tmp/ssh-??) when you connect from A-\u0026gt;B. Then when you connect B-\u0026gt;C instead of C interacting with B\u0026rsquo;s agent, it interacts with the forwarded Agent provided by A.\nConfiguration  Make sure \u0026lsquo;AllowAgentForwarding no\u0026rsquo; is not set it in /etc/ssh/sshd_config on B (it defaults to yes if it\u0026rsquo;s not explicitly set to no). Make sure your client config has \u0026lsquo;ForwardAgent yes\u0026rsquo;, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely want to do this which specific hosts you trust/control, as a program on B will able to login as you (only while you\u0026rsquo;re connected) if it wants. Edit ~/.ssh/config and add something similar to the following:  Host examplehost.com ForwardAgent yes  \n Tell your ssh-agent on A that you want make an identity available through it. Run the follow from a terminal:  ssh-add  \nThat\u0026rsquo;s it. You should be able to login to C from B using your credentials securely stored on A.  ","href":"/posts/2012-12-28-ssh-agent-forwarding/","title":"SSH Agent Forwarding"},{"content":" The HTTPS system allows you to communicate securely with a server and trust it\u0026rsquo;s idenity. This is how it\u0026rsquo;s generally used. However it\u0026rsquo;s also possible for the server to trust the identity of the client as well.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fairly straight forward to take advantage of this with Node.js, below you will find a simple tutorial for doing just that.\nKeys and Certs First, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need all your certs and keys. Follow along with the instructions below to do so. It\u0026rsquo;s adapted from this article.\nNotice the \u0026lsquo;365\u0026rsquo;.

There was some frustration directed towards the problem knowing which modules are of high quality. This is an acknowledged pain point in the node.js community but it\u0026rsquo;ll get better soon.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting this problem has been discussed a couple times by the current node Project Manager isaacs on the NodeUp* podcast, though I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly sure which. Apparently they\u0026rsquo;re working a new version of npm website right now.\nIn the meantime, finding quality node modules isn\u0026rsquo;t all that hard. With a bit of experience you\u0026rsquo;ll start to recognize names and learn to judge module quality quite quickly. Here\u0026rsquo;s some tips:\n the following gives you the most depended on modules http://search.npmjs.org/#/_browse/deps take a look at this list first take note of the names of these authors you\u0026rsquo;ll notice certain people or organizations publish a lot (substack and NodeJitsu for instance ) also take a look at the modules wiki at https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules otherwise search http://search.npmjs.org/ visit the github page for the module, it\u0026rsquo;s usually next to the name there\u0026rsquo;s no real excuse not to have a github page (or google code I supposed), I avoid these modules look for a clean well written README if someone really wants you to use their module they\u0026rsquo;ll make it easy to do so with a synopsis/quick start/tutorial does the module have watchers? tests? how does the code look? are there alternatives? how hard is to write your own?  * The NodeUp podcast is great.
