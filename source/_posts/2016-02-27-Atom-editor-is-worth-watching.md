As I write my blog in markdown, I see the live results a separate pane to the right. It's only been a few minutes but so far I'm very impressed with [Atom](http://atom.io). You should go check it out if you haven't already. I might even give it a try as JavaScript IDE (node).

In particular the git integration seems interesting. When you edit a file, it indicates which lines have changed, and which are new. This very promising. It's easy to see where GitHub is going with this, and I like it.

It's built with [Electron](http://http://electron.atom.io/) which is also terrific as well. Turns out these projects are being made (with love) by GitHub. Lots of great [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) coming out of GitHub. Thanks!
